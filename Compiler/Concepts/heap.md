The heap is an area from which memory (for variables) can be dynamically allocated at run time.

A variable size segment of contiguous virtual memory that begins just after the uninitialized data segment of a process and grows and shrinks as memory is allocated and freed

**The top end of the heap is called the [[program break]]**

# Some Critical Concepts

## Leading dimension of an array/matrix
[How Leading Dimension Is Used for Matrices - IBM Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/essl/6.3?topic=matrices-how-leading-dimension-is-used)

Suppose matrices are store in _column-major_.

The **leading dimension** for a two-dimensional array is an _increment_ that is used to find the _starting point_ for the matrix elements in each successive _column_ of the array.

```
+---------------------------+
| 1.0 8.0  15.0 | 22.0 29.0 |    suppose we have a matrix M
| 2.0 9.0  16.0 | 23.0 30.0 |    stored in an array A[7][5],
| 3.0 10.0 17.0 | 24.0 31.0 |    at location A[0:5, 0:3]
| 4.0 11.0 18.0 | 25.0 32.0 |    then the leading dimention
| 5.0 12.0 19.0 | 26.0 33.0 |    is 7, since the next col of 
+---------------+           |    M is 7 elems awary in A.
| 6.0 13.0 20.0   27.0 34.0 | 
| 7.0 14.0 21.0   28.0 35.0 |

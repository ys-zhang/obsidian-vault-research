## SCC (Strongly connected component)

>[!def] strongly connected
>In the mathematical theory of _directed graphs_, a graph is said to be **strongly connected** if every vertex is **reachable** from every other vertex.
> 
> A _directed graph_ is called **strongly connected** if there is a _path_ for in both direction of every pair of vertices in the graph.

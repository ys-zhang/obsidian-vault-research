## length of choice sequence is highly correlated to size of generated test case

> The length of the choice sequence is a strong but not perfect predictor of the test case size.

Intuitively, test cases of larger size needs to generate more fields which consumes more choice bits.

However, _rejection sampling_ may abandon a large chunk of sequence if the generated value cannot pass some filter. Thus the correlation can be low when
1. generate value within some bound by rejection
2. test properties that includes a _implies_ structure, such as "if p then q" and "p => q".

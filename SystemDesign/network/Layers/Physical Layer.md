# Problem
- How to transmit bits
- [[bandwidth]]



# Multiplex

Channels are often shared by multiple signals. After all, it is much more convenient to use a single wire to carry several signals than to install a wire for every signal. This kind of sharing is called **multiplexing**.

- **FDM** (Frequency Division Multiplexing)
- **TDM** (Time Division Multiplexing)
- **CDM** (Code Division Multiplexing)
- **CDMA** (Code Division Multiple Access)

• The **starting non-terminal** $S$ does not appear on the right side of any **production rule**.
• The starting non-terminal $S$ may have the production rule $S \to \epsilon$.
• The right side of every other production rule is either a single terminal symbol or a string of exactly two non-terminals—that is, every other production rule has the form $A \to BC$ or $A \to a$.

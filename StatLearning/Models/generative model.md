models the joint distribution $P(X, Y)$.

> one can estimate the joint distribution $P(X, Y)$ (_generative model_), from that compute the conditional probability $P(Y|X)$, and then base classification on that. These are increasingly indirect, but *increasingly probabilistic*, *allowing more domain knowledge and probability theory to be applied*.


typical generative model approaches include 
- [[naive Bayes classifiers]]
- [[Gaussian mixture models]], 
- [[variational autoencoders]]
- [[GAN]]
and others.

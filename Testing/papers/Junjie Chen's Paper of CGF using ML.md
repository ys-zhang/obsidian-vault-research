# Coverage Prediction for Accelerating Compiler Testing
COP consists of three steps: 
1. predicting coverage for test programs (see Section 3.1)
2. clustering test programs (see Section 3.2)
3. and prioritizing test programs (see Section 3.3).

## Predicting Coverage

> The key insight of predicting coverage is that test programs with some specific language features, operation features, and structure features are more likely to cover some specific code regions of compiler modules

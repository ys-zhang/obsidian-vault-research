#program-analysis #compiler 

A _dataflow analysis_ computes some dataflow information at each _program point_ in the _control flow graph_.

Let $\sigma$ denotes the dataflow information which maps variables to some value domain.
$$
 \sigma : Var \to L 
$$
The elements of $L$ are referred as _abstract values_. You can think $L$ to be some label or true value in some logic.

# Branching 

In CFG when multiple edges "meets" at the same node, make the node have multiple parents, the dataflow information $\sigma_{pre}$ from different branches may not match with each other.

To solve this conflict, we require $L$ to be a [[Lattice]], or more accurate a _join semi-lattice_.

In other words, _join (least upper-bound)_ exists for each pair of elements in $L$.
$$
\forall x, y\in L.\; (x \sqcup y) := \inf\{e\in L: x\le e, y\le e\}
$$
use the join of $\sigma_{post}$ computed from each parent of the node as the result.

>[!def] top & bottom
> usually there is an element in $L$ represents that we are not certain about the abstract value of the variable which is dubbed _top_ and denoted by $\top$, the name _top_ is from [[Lattice]]
>
> we use $\bot$ to denote the dataflow information of a program point than has not been analysed. This is critical when there is a incoming branch that is originated from a node that we have not met yet, but its value is needed for analysing the current node. 

# Loop

use fix-point in dataflow for loops, basically, we run the dataflow analysis in the loop until post dataflow information reaches a fix-point, i.e., do not change any  reaches a fix-point, i.e., do not change any more.

```haskell
flow :: i -> Trie Var a -> Trie Var a
flow (Loop xs) = 
  fix $ \rec pre -> 
    let post = trans pre
    in  if post == pre 
          then post
           else rec post 
 where 
  trans pre = foldr pre flow (reverse xs)
  
```

we first use a map to represent the dataflow information $\sigma$ (we can make a [[Trie#Generalised Trie|generalised trie]] from a function, and convert it back to a function in Haskell).

# Theory

## Termination

>[!thm] dataflow analysis terminination
> If a dataflow lattice has _finite height_ and the flow function is _monotonic_, the _work list algorithm_ will terminate.

>[!def] monotonic
> a function $f$ on a lattice $(L, \sqsubseteq)$ is _monotonic_ if 
> $$ x \sqsubseteq y \implies f(x) \sqsubseteq f(y) $$

### Widening 

The termination theorem requires the lattice to have finite height.

One trick to deal with the problem of _infinite ascending chain_ is to _trade termination with [[#Precision|precision]]_, which consists of 3 step:
1. whether we are in a possible infinite ascending chain? or shall we run the infinite ascending chain detect algorithm
2. the infinite ascending chain detect algorithm
3. terminate the infinite ascending chain with some upper-bound in the lattice

The trick gets its name because upper abstract values usually represents a wider range of concrete values.

## Correctness

Intuitively, we would like the program analysis results to correctly describe every actual execution of the program.


>[!def] soundness
>The result $\langle \sigma_n | n \in P \rangle$ of a program analysis running on program $P$ is sound iff, for all traces $T$ of $P$ , for all $i$ such that $0\le i < length(T)$ we have $\alpha(c_i) \sqsubseteq \sigma_{n_i}$

>[!thm] correctness
>If a dataflow analysisâ€™s flow function $f$ is _monotonic_ and _locally sound_, and for all traces $T$ we have $\alpha(c_0) \sqsubseteq \sigma_0$ where $\sigma_0$ is the initial analysis information, then any _fixed point_ $\{\sigma_n | n \in P\}$  of the analysis is sound.

>[!def] program trace
> A _trace_ is a formalisation of an execution of the program.

> A _trace_ $T$ of a program $P$ is a potentially infinite sequence ($\{c_0, c_1, \dots\}$) of _program configuration_ (see [[Operational Semantics]]) where

> $$ F(\sigma)_i = \bigsqcup_{j\in \mathrm{pred}(i)} f_j(\sigma_j)$$

## Precision

let $\Gamma(j)$ denotes all _concrete configurations_ that can be observed at _instruction_ $j$.

$$
  \Gamma(j) = \big\{ c \;|\; c = \langle E, j\rangle, \;c\in \mathrm{Traces}(P) \big\}
$$

>A dataflow analysis result $\langle \sigma_n | n \in P \rangle$ of program $P$ is _optimally precise_ iff 
>$$ \sigma_i = \bigsqcup_{c\in \Gamma(i)} \alpha(c) $$
> In other words, its the _join_ of all possible _abstract values_ that can be observed at the _program point_ $i$.
>
> It is not possible to get the result, since it requires to solve the _reachability problem_ of CFG paths.


>[!def] MOP approximation

> $$ OPT \sqsubseteq MOP \sqsubseteq LFP $$
>Furthemore, if _flow functions_ are _distributive_ then the _least fixed point_ analysis result is exactly _MOP_ 

>[!def] distributive

>[!def] least fixed point

# Interprocedural Analysis

>[!remark] inter- & intra-
>the prefix "inter-" means _between_ or _among_ groups while "intra-" means _within_ or _inside_

## function call instrucions

In _interprocedural analysis_ we treat function calls as a single instruction, and we need inference rules for these "function instructions".

There is some other problems we needs to consider:
- precondition of the function
- postcondition of the function
- side-effects of the function
- recursive function calls

>[!tip] idea
>we can treat a function as a single program and do dataflow analysis, suppose:
>- we have a initial dataflow info $\sigma_0 = L_a$ 
>- the analysis gives a info after the return instruction satisfies $\sigma_{return} \sqsubseteq L_r$
>- the flow function $f$ is _monotonic_
>
> Then we have $\forall \sigma_0 \sqsubseteq L_a$
> $$  \sigma_{return} = f(\sigma_0) \sqsubseteq f(L_a) = \sigma_{return} \sqsubseteq L_r  $$
> The problem becomes how to choose $L_a$?

Side-effect of mutating global variables can be handled by treating these global variable as both input and output of the function.

## Context Sensitive Analysis

> **Context-sensitive analysis** analyses a function either multiple times, or parametrically, so that _the analysis results returned to different call sites reflect the different analysis results passed in at those call sites_.


>[!remark]
>This is much like _function inlining_, we inline the function's local CFG to the whole program CFG. However, inlining do **not** support _recursive functions_

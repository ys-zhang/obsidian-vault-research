#category-theory 

Given a category $\mathscr C$,  we define the $\mathscr C$'s **arrow category** $\mathscr C^{\to}$ as follows:
1. the _objects_ of the arrow category are morphisms in $\mathscr C$, i.e., $$ f : A \to B $$
2. the _morphisms_ of the arrow category are commutative squares, 
        $$
        \begin{CD}
         A @>f>> B \\
         @ViVV @VVjV \\
         C @>g>> D
        \end{CD}
    $$
        and $(i,j): f \to g$

# Prepare

Two plugins is needed for _scoping_, _completion menu support_ in MPS Kotlin:
1. _MPS Kotlin Typesystem_
2. _MPS Coderules Typechecking_

Currently the _EAP channel(`https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/eap/list`)_ needs to be [enabled](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html?_ga=2.26340861.1363634769.1667792124-896041081.1665580563&_gl=1*lwtjgq*_ga*ODk2MDQxMDgxLjE2NjU1ODA1NjM.*_ga_9J976DJZ68*MTY2ODA0NjM4Ni40OS4xLjE2NjgwNDYzODguMC4wLjA.#add_plugin_repos) to find these 2 plugins 


# Pitfalls

>[!WARNING] Enable `Coderules`
>You must make sure `Coderules` is **enabled** or _completion menu_ will not work.
>
>Occasionally, you may find _code completion menu_ stop working. 
>
>**Toggle Coderules off and on can solve this problem** 
>
>You can toggle `Coderules` on by click the `CR` button at the right bottom corner of MPS

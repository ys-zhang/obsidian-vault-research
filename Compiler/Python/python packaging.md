# History of package distribution

1. `distutils`is the original build and distribution system first added to the Python standard library in 1998.
2. `setuptools` is a (largely) drop-in replacement for `distutils` first published in 2004. Its most notable addition over the unmodified `distutils` tools was the ability to *declare dependencies on other packages*.
3. `wheel` is a project that adds the `bdist_wheel` command to `setuptools`

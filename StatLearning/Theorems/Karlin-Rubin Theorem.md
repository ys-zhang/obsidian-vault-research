Hypothesis:

$$
\begin{align}
H_0:&\;\; \theta \le \theta_0 \\
H_1:&\;\; \theta > \theta_0
\end{align}
$$
suppose $T$ is the [[Sufficient Statistic]] of $\theta$ and the distribution of $T$ , $\Pr(t|\theta)$ has a [[Concepts of Statistic Test#MLR Monotone Likelihood Ratio|monotone likelihood ratio]] , 
then $\forall t_0$ the test with _rejection region_
$$
R = \{T>t_0\}
$$
is a [[Concepts of Statistic Test#UMP Uniformly Most Powerful Test|UMP]].

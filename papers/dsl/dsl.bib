@article{Cheng:2020wy,
	abstract = {In model-driven engineering, model transformation (MT) verification is essential for reliably producing software artifacts. While recent advancements have enabled automatic Hoare-style verification for non-trivial MTs, there are certain verification tasks (e.g. induction) that are intrinsically difficult to automate. Existing tools that aim at simplifying the interactive verification of MTs typically translate the MT specification (e.g. in ATL) and properties to prove (e.g. in OCL) into an interactive theorem prover. However, since the MT specification and proof phases happen in separate languages, the proof developer needs a detailed knowledge of the translation logic. Naturally, any error in the MT translation could cause unsound verification, i.e. the MT executed in the original environment may have different semantics from the verified MT. We propose an alternative solution by designing and implementing an internal domain-specific language, namely CoqTL, for the specification of declarative MTs directly in the Coq interactive theorem prover. Expressions in CoqTL are written in Gallina (the specification language of Coq), increasing the possibilities of reusing native Coq libraries in the transformation definition and proof. CoqTL specifications can be directly executed by our transformation engine encoded in Coq, or a certified implementation of the transformation can be generated by the native Coq extraction mechanism. We ensure that CoqTL has the same expressive power of Gallina (i.e. if a MT can be computed in Gallina, then it can also be represented in CoqTL). In this article, we introduce CoqTL, evaluate its practical applicability on a use case, and identify its current limitations.},

	abstract = {In the last decades the interest in the problem of comparing and har- monizing legislation has been steadily increasing. One reason is the increasing legal convergence between governments in the European Union, and the increasing traffic of people over borders of jurisdic- tions. Another reason is the increasing globalization of companies; Products and services are offered in many jurisdictions at the same time, and the product or service has to meet the provisions of all jurisdictions in which it is offered. In the E-POWER project rel- evant tax legislation and business processes are modeled in UML to improve the speed and efficiency with which the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration can implement decision support systems for internal use and for its clients. These conceptual models have also proven their usefulness for efficient and effective analysis of draft legislation. We are currently researching whether conceptual modeling can also be used to compare `similar' legislation from different jurisdictions to improve the capacity of the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration to react to future consequences of in- creased movement of people, products, and money between EU member states and increased harmonization between tax authori- ties in Europe. In addition, addressing the problem of comparing models is also expected to improve our methodology for model- ing legislation. This paper discusses problems and requirements of comparing legislation as we understand them now, and attempts to relate them to relevant research.},

@article{AITAMEUR2016100,
	abstract = {Modeling languages are concerned with providing techniques and tool support for the design, synthesis and analysis of the models resulting from a given modeling activity, this activity being usually part of a system development model or process. These languages quite successfully focused on the analysis of the designed system exploiting the expressed semantic power of the underlying modeling language. The semantics of these modeling languages are well understood by the system designers and/or the modeling language users i.e. implicit semantics. In general, modeling languages are not equipped with resources, concepts or entities handling explicitly domain engineering features and characteristics (domain knowledge) in which the modeled systems evolve. Indeed, the designer has to explicitly handle the knowledge issued and/or mined from an analysis of this application domain i.e. explicit semantics. Nowadays, making explicit the domain knowledge inside system design models does not obey to any methodological rule validated by the practice. The modeling languages users introduce through types, constraints, profiles, etc. these domain knowledge features. Our claim is that ontologies are good candidates for handling explicit domain knowledge. They define domain theories and provide resources for uniquely identifying domain knowledge concepts. Therefore, allowing models to make references to ontologies is a modular solution for models to explicitly handle domain knowledge. Overcoming the absence of explicit semantics expression in the modeling languages used to specify systems models will increase the robustness of the designed system models. Indeed, the axioms and theorems resulting from the ontologies, thanks to references, can be used to strengthen the properties of the designed models. The objective of this paper is to offer rigorous mechanisms for handling domain knowledge in design models. This paper also shows how these mechanisms are set up in the cases of static, dynamic and formal models.},

@article{10.1145/358438.349331,
	abstract = {Functional Reactive Programming, or FRP, is a general framework for programming hybrid systems in a high-level, declarative manner. The key ideas in FRP are its notions of behaviors and events. Behaviors are time-varying, reactive values, while events are time-ordered sequences of discrete-time event occurrences. FRP is the essence of Fran, a domain-specific language embedded in Haskell for programming reactive animations, but FRP is now also being used in vision, robotics and other control systems applications. In this paper we explore the formal semantics of FRP and how it relates to an implementation based on streams that represent (and therefore only approximate) continuous behaviors. We show that, in the limit as the sampling interval goes to zero, the implementation is faithful to the formal, continuous semantics, but only when certain constraints on behaviors are observed. We explore the nature of these constraints, which vary amongst the FRP primitives. Our results show both the power and limitations of this approach to language design and implementation. As an example of a limitation, we show that streams are incapable of representing instantaneous predicate events over behaviors.},

We also provide a denotational semantics for this new interface, and a technique (using Kripke logical relations) for reasoning about which FRP functions may "forget their past", i.e. which functions do not have an inherent space-leak. Finally, we show how we have implemented this interface as a Haskell library called FRPNow. },

This method allows programmers to save work by writing programs that are brief but also underspecified and underconstrained; a human-in-the-loop "data compiler" then automatically fills in missing values without the programmer's explicit help. It uses modern data quality mechanisms such as information extraction, data integration, and crowdsourcing. The language encourages users to mention knowledge graph entities in their programs, thus enabling the data compiler to exploit the extensive factual and type structure present in modern KGs. We describe the knowledge graph programming user experience, explain its conceptual steps and data model, describe our prototype KGP system, and present some preliminary experimental results.},

	abstract = {Software architects create and consume many interrelated artifacts during the architecting process. These artifacts may represent functional and nonfunctional requirements, architectural patterns, infrastructure topology units, code, and deployment descriptors as well as architecturally significant design decisions. Design decisions have to be linked to chunks of architecture description in order to achieve a fine-grained control when a design is modified. Moreover, it is imperative to identify quickly the key decisions affected by a runtime change that are critical for a system's mission. This paper extends previous work on architectural knowledge with a metamodel for architectural decision capturing and sharing to: (i) create and maintain fine-grained dependency links between the entities during decision identification, making, and enforcement, (ii) keep track of the evolution of the decisions, and (iii) support runtime decisions.},

Methods, models, and tools supporting explicit knowledge management strategies have been proposed in recent years; however, several challenges remain unaddressed. In this paper, we extend our previous work to overcome these challenges and to satisfy the requirements of an additional user group, presales architects that are responsible for IT service solution proposals. In strategic outsourcing, such solution proposals require complex, contractually relevant design decisions concerning many different resources such as IT infrastructures, people, and real estate. To support both presales and project architects, we define a common reference architecture and a decision process-oriented metamodel. We also present a tool implementation of these concepts and discuss their application to outsourcing proposals and application development projects. Finally, we establish twelve decision modeling principles and practices that capture the practical experience gained and lessons learned during the application of our decision modeling concepts to both proposal development and architecture design work on projects.},

	abstract = {The impact of Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) on software design is considerable. They allow programs to be more concise than equivalent programs written in a high-level programming languages. They relieve programmers from making decisions about data-structure and algorithm design, and thus allows solutions to be constructed quickly. Because DSL's are at a higher level of abstraction they are easier to maintain and reason about than equivalent programs written in a high-level language, and perhaps most importantly they can be written by domain experts rather than programmers.The problem is that DSL implementation is costly and prone to errors, and that high level approaches to DSL implementation often produce inefficient systems. By using two new programming language mechanisms, program staging and monadic abstraction, we can lower the cost of DSL implementations by allowing reuse at many levels. These mechanisms provide the expressive power that allows the construction of many compiler components as reusable libraries, provide a direct link between the semantics and the low-level implementation, and provide the structure necessary to reason about the implementation.},

@article{shen2021domain,
	abstract = {As a part of domain-specific development, Domain-Specific Language (DSL) is widely used in both the academia and industry to solve different aspects of the problems in engineering. A DSL is a customized language whose expressiveness is tailored to a well-defined application domain, so as to offer an effective interface for the domain experts. To mitigate the programming complexity of the General-Purpose Programming Languages, and meanwhile maintain the precise expression towards some exact engineering domains, DSLs present a higher level of abstraction than low-level interfaces, while providing much more flexibility than high-level interfaces. Nevertheless, it lacks a survey to have a systematic overview of the essential commonalities shared by those works. In this survey, we take a brand-new perspective, to categorize the state-of-the-art works into different categories, tailored to three fundamental implementation concerns of DSLs: abstract syntax, concrete syntax, and semantics. Specifically, they are characterized according to their parsing and mapping strategy (external/internal) between the abstract syntax and concrete syntax, the mapping results (textual/graphical symbols), and also the functions they emphasize (modeling, visualizing, etc.). Integrated with the literature, we finally summarized the research overview of DSLs.},

Domain-specific languages (DSLs) can be developed as an alternative method for code abstraction and distribution, sometimes preferable to APIs because of their expressivity and tailored development environment. 

However the cost of implementing a fully functional development environment for a DSL is generally higher. 

In this paper we propose DSLit, a prototype-tool that, given an existing API, reduces the cost of developing a corresponding DSL by analyzing the API, automatically generating a semantically equivalent DSL with its complete development environment, and allowing for user customization. To build this bridge between the API and DSL technical spaces we make use of exist- ing Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques, further promoting the vision of MDE as a unifying technical space.},

They offer substantial gains in expressiveness and ease of use compared with general-purpose programming languages in their domain of application. DSL development is hard, requiring both domain knowledge and language development expertise. Few people have both. Not surprisingly, the decision to develop a DSL is often postponed indefinitely, if considered at all, and most DSLs never get beyond the application library stage.

Although many articles have been written on the development of particular DSLs, there is very limited literature on DSL development methodologies and many questions remain regarding when and how to develop a DSL. To aid the DSL developer, we identify patterns in the decision, analysis, design, and implementation phases of DSL development. Our patterns improve and extend earlier work on DSL design patterns. We also discuss domain analysis tools and language development systems that may help to speed up DSL development. Finally, we present a number of open problems.},

What compli- cates model-driven engineering is that it requires multiple dimensions of evolution. In regular evolution, the model- ing language is used to make the changes. In meta-model evolution, changes are required to the modeling notation. In platform evolution, the code generators and application framework change to reflect new requirements on the target platform. Finally, in abstraction evolution, new modeling languages are added to the set of (modeling) languages to reflect increased understanding of a technical or business domain. While MDE has been optimized for regular evo- lution, presently little or no support exists for metamodel, platform and abstraction evolution.

	abstract = {More than five years ago, the OMG proposed the Model Driven Architecture (MDATM) approach to deal with the separation of platform dependent and independent aspects in information systems. Since then, the initial idea of MDA evolved and Model Driven Engineering (MDE) is being increasingly promoted to handle separation and combination of various kinds of concerns in software or data engineering. MDE is more general than the set of standards and practices recommended by the OMG's MDA proposal. In MDE the concept of model designates not only OMG models but a lot of other artifacts like XML documents, Java programs, RDBMS data, etc. Today we observe another evolutionary step. A convergence between MDE and DSL (Domain Specific Language) engineering is rapidly appearing. In the same way as MDE is a generalization of MDA, the DSL engineering may be viewed as a generalization of MDE. One of the goals of this paper is to explore the potential of this important evolution of engineering practices. In order to anchor the discussion on practical grounds, we present a set of typical problems that could be solved by classical (object-oriented and others), MDE, or DSL-based techniques. Solutions to these problems will be based on current platforms (EMF, AMMA, GME, etc.). This paper illustrates how powerful model-based frameworks, allowing to use and build a variety of DSLs, may help to solve complex problems in a more efficient way.},

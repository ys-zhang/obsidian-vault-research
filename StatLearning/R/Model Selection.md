##### Criteria and Idea

>[!Idea]
>**Best subset regression** finds for each $k \in \{0, 1, 2, . . . , p\}$ the **subset of size** $k$ that gives **smallest residual sum of squares** 


For $k = 1 \dots p$ , select $k$ predictors in all $p$ variables that minimize **RSS** 
$$
\min_{\|\beta\|_0\le k} \|Y-X\beta\|^2_2
$$

> the best subset selection problem is nonconvex and is known to be NP-hard.
> An efficient algorithm the _leaps and bounds procedure_ (Furnival and Wilson, 1974)â€”makes this feasible for $p$ as large as $30$ or $40$.

>[!WARNING]
>It minimizes the RSS i.e., the train error and may not optimal in prediction.
>Maybe it's better to consider cross-validation or AIC, BIC

# Forward(Backward) Stepwise(Stagewise) Selection

1. Forward-stepwise selection starts with the intercept, and then sequentially _adds into the model the predictor_ that most improves the fit. 
2. Backward-stepwise selection starts with the full model, and sequentially _deletes the predictor that has the least impact_ on the fit. The candidate for dropping is the variable with the smallest [[Linear Models#t-Test Individual Coefficient|Z-score]]. 
3. It starts like forward-stepwise regression, with an intercept equal to $\bar y$, and centered predictors with coefficients initially all $0$. At each step the algorithm identifies the variable _most correlated with the current residual_.

##### Package
`step` function in R defined in package `stats` selects a formula-based model by AIC using forward stepwise selection.

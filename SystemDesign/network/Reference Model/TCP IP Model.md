# The Link Layer

All these requirements led to the choice of a packet-switching network based on a connectionless layer that runs across different networks. The lowest layer in the model, the link layer describes what links such as serial lines and classic Ethernet must do to meet the needs of this connectionless internet layer.


# Internet Layer

Its job is to permit hosts to inject packets into any network and have them travel independently to the destination.

We have:

- [[IP | IP ((Internet Protocol) ]]
- [[ ICMP | ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)]]

> The job of the internet layer is to deliver IP packets where they are supposed to go. Packet routing is clearly a major issue here, as is congestion (though IP has not proven effective at avoiding congestion).


# Transport Layer

> It is designed to allow peer entities on the source and destination hosts to carry on a conversation.

- TCP
- UDP

# Application Layer

# sqlserver

A SQL Server index is an on-disk or in-memory structure associated with a table or view that speeds retrieval of rows from the table or view.


In SQL Server, **rowstore** refers to table where the underlying data storage format is a heap, a [[B-tree]]([[Database/index/clustered index]]), or a memory-optimized table.

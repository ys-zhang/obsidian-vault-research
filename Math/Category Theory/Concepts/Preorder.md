A preorder is **a category where there is at most one morphism going from any object a to any object b**. 

Another name for such a category is “thin.”  A preorder is a **thin category**.

If $\exists$ an arrow from object $X$ to $Y$ in the preorder we say
$$
X \le Y
$$

# Inference Rules

by the rule of composition we have the **transitivity rule** of $\le$ , i.e.

$$
X\le Y \land Y\le Z \implies X \le Z
$$
and the existence of $id_X$ for all objects $X$ we have the **reflexivity rule**:  
$$
\vdash X\le X
$$

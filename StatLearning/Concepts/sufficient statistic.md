>a statistic is **sufficient** for a family of [[probability distribution]]s if the sample from which it is calculated gives no additional information than the statistic,

A statistic $t = T(X)$ is **sufficient for underlying parameter $\theta$** precisely if the conditional probability distribution of the data $X$, given the statistic$t = T(X)$, does not depend on the parameter $\theta$.

$$
f_X(x) = h(x)g_{\theta}(T(x))
$$


> In statistics, a statistic is **sufficient** with respect to a [statistical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model "Statistical model") and its associated unknown parameter if "no other statistic that can be calculated from the same sample provides any additional information as to the value of the parameter".

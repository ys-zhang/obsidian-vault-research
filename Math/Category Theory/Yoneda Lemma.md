 The _Yoneda lemma_ tells us that 
 1. All _$Set$-valued functors_ can be obtained from _hom-functors_ through natural transformations, and it explicitly enumerates all such transformations.
 2. A natural transformation between a _hom-functor_ and any other functor $F$ is completely determined by specifying the value of its single component at just one point.

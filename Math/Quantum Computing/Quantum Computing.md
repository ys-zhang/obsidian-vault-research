Choosing a direction to measure spin corresponds to choosing an ordered, orthonormal basis $(|b_1\rangle, |b_2\rangle)$, which corresponding to 2 possible outcomes.

Before we measure the spin, the particle will be in a _spin state_ given by a linear combination of $|b_1\rangle$ and $|b_2\rangle$, that is, it has the form $c_1|b_1\rangle + c_2|b_2\rangle$.
- the probability corresponding to $|b_i\rangle$ is $c_i^2$,
- $c_1^2 + c_2^2 = 1$
- $c_i$ is called _probability amplitude_

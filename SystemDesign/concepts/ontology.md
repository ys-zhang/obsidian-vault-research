In short, on our preliminary understanding of it: 
1. say what there is, what _exists_, what the stuff of reality is made out of;
2. say what the most _general_ _features_ and _relations_ of these things are.

As a first approximation, **ontology** is _the study of what there is_. problems in ontology in this sense mean that _they deal with whether or not a certain thing, or more broadly entity, exists_.

**Ontology** is usually also taken to encompass problems about the most _general features and relations of the entities which do exist_. For example, the problem of how a universal relates to a particular that has it (assuming there are universals and particulars), or the problem of how an event like John eating a cookie relates to the particulars J

# tmux Model and Concepts

-   Programs run in terminals in **panes**, which each belong to one **window**.
-   Each window has a name and one active pane.
-   **Windows** are linked to one or more **sessions**.
-   Each **session** has a list of **windows**, each with an index.
-   One of the windows in a session is the **current window**.
-   **Sessions** are attached to zero or more **clients**.
-   Each **client** is attached to one **session**.

# String
- Fix an _arbitrary finite set_ $\Sigma$ called the **alphabet**; the individual elements of $\Sigma$ are called **symbols** or **characters**.
- A **string** (or **word**) over $\Sigma$ is a finite sequence of _zero or more symbols_ from $\Sigma$.
- **concatenation** ($\bullet:: \Sigma^* \to \Sigma^* \to \Sigma^*$)
$$
  w \bullet z = \begin{cases}
  z  & w=\epsilon \\
  a\cdot (x \bullet z) & w = a\cdot x
  \end{cases} 
$$


# Context Free Language


>[!TLDR]
> 1. Intuitively, a **language is regular** if it can be built from individual strings by **concatenation, union, and repetition**.
> 2. **Context-free languages** are languages that can be built from individual strings by **concatenation, union, and recursion**.



A **context-free grammar**, which is a structure with the following components:
- A finite set $\Sigma$, whose elements are called symbols or **terminals**.
- A finite set $\Gamma$ disjoint from $\Sigma$, whose elements are called **non-terminals**.
- A finite set $R$ of production rules of the form $A \to w$, where $A \in \Gamma$ is a non-terminal and $w \in (\Sigma \cup \Gamma)^*$ is a string of symbols and variables.
- A **starting non-terminal**, typically denoted $S$.


>[!EXAMPLE] Example: Production Rule 
>
>1. $S \to A | B$
>2. $A \to 0A | 0C$
>3. $B \to B1 | C1$
>4. $C \to \epsilon | 0C1$


We can apply a production rule to a string in $(\Sigma \cup \Gamma)^*$ by replacing any instance of the non-terminal on the left of the rule with the string on the right.

The **context free language** is the languages generated by the starting non-terminal $S$.

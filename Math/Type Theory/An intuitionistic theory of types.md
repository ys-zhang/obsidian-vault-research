# 1 Basic Concepts: Informal Explanation

We shall think of _mathematical objects or constructions_. Every mathematical object is of a certain kind or type. 
Better, a mathematical object is always given together with its type, that is, it is not just an object, it is an object of a certain type.

>[!def] type, informally
> A **type** is defined by prescribing what we have to do in order to _construct an object_ of that type. 

>[!def] proposition, informally
> A **proposition** is defined by prescribing how we are allowed to prove it.

>[!remark] 
>Note the above definitions is _intuitionistic_.
>In other words, the mathematical object is not defined by behaviour, but by construction.

> <mark class="hltr-orange">The basic transaction of life insurance is an exchange</mark>; the policyholder pays premiums in return for a later payment from the insurer which is life contingent, by which we mean that it depends on the death or survival or possibly the state of health of the policyholder.
> 
> We usually use the term **‘insurance/assurance’** when the benefit is paid as a single lump sum, either on the death of the policyholder or on survival to a predetermined **maturity date**.

- The earliest life insurance policies provided that the policyholder would pay an amount, called the **premium**, to the insurer. If the named life insured died during the year that the contract was in force, the insurer would pay a <mark class="hltr-pink">predetermined lump sum</mark>, the **sum insured**, to the policyholder or his or her estate.
- **Annual contracts**. Each year the premium would increase as the probability of death increased.
- The method of matching income and outgo annually, with <mark class="hltr-pink">no attempt to smooth</mark> or balance the premiums over the years, is called **assessmentism**.
- The **level premium policy** offered the policyholder the option to <mark class="hltr-pink">lock-in a regular premium</mark>, payable perhaps weekly, monthly, quarterly or annually, for a number of years.
- A **life table** summarises a _survival model_ by specifying the proportion of lives that are expected to survive to each age.
- **Term insurance** pays a lump sum benefit on the death of the policyholder, provided death occurs before the end of a specified term.
    - **Level term insurance** indicates a level sum insured and regular, level premiums.
    - **Decreasing term insurance** indicates that the sum insured and (usually) premiums decrease over the term of the contract.
    - **Renewable term insurance** offers the policyholder the option of renewing the policy at the end of the original term, without further evidence of the policyholder’s health status.

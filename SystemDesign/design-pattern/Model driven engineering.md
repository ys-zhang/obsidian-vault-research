# Concepts

**Model-driven engineering (MDE)** is the unification of initiatives that aim to improve software development by employing _high-level_, _domain specific_, models in Development Life Cycle (the _implementation_, _integration_, _maintenance_, and _testing_) of software systems.


**Models** are an integral part of the software evolution process. Developers represent designs using models that conform to an appropriate meta-model, which are then _automatically_ transformed to implementations.

> _Software development_ is envisioned as a series of _model transformation_ steps


# Problem


> The problem with _model-driven engineering_ is that it can lead to a _lock-in in the abstractions_ and generator technology adopted when the project was started.

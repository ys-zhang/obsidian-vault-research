give a sentence $y=\langle y_1, \cdots, y_n \rangle$. modelling the chance to see the sentence under some context  i.e. its probability

$$
\Pr(y_1, \cdots, y_n)
$$

# Modelling with [[RNN.md | RNN]]

## Data clean

sentence to [[word embedding]].
- `<EOS>` token for end of sentence
- `<UNK>` token for unknown word

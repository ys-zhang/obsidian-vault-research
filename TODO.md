Data Structures and Algorithms, Operating Systems, Databases, Networks, etc.
> You will be expected to know and apply common data structures such as: lists, maps, stacks, priority queues, binary trees, graphs, sets, etc. You will likely need to talk about how they are implemented and why you would choose one implementation or data structure over another. Most importantly you will need to be able to pick the right data structure and algorithm for a specific problem.

CTMC extend [[DTMC (discrete-time Markov chain)]] over state space $S$ with a function 
$$
  r: S\to \mathbb R_+
$$
assigning to each state $s$ of a residence distribution $T_s$, representing the amount of time the chain stays at state $s$ before performing a new transition:
$$
\Pr(T_s\le t) = 1 - \exp(-r(s)\cdot t)
$$
Another equivalent view of CTMC is to combine the transition probability $P$ and the rate function $r$ by
$$
  R(s, s') = P(s, s') \cdot r(s)
$$
representing the transition rate from $s$ to $s'$.

The probability to move from $s$ to $s'$ in the time interval $[0,t]$ is
$$
  \frac{R(s, s')}{r(s)} \cdot (1-e^{-r(s)\cdot t})
$$
> [!NOTE]
> Whereas in a DTMC, a path is simply an infinite sequence of states, in a CTMC we need to keep track on how long we stay in each state.

# Probability Measure defined on paths

A CTMC introduces a probability measure on the space of infinite timed paths, where a timed path a series of states along with the time interval when stays in the state:

$$
  s_0t_0s_1t_1\dots s_nt_n \dots
$$
meaning 
- starts with state $s_0$ and stays for time length $t_0$, 
- then jumps to $s_1$, and stays for time length $t_1$,
- ...
- jumps to $s_n$ and stays for time length $t_n$
- ...

The measurable set is the [[Sigma-algebra]] generated by cylinder sets, i.e., set of paths share a common prefix, for instance,
$$
s_0I_0s_1I_1s_2I_2s_3 := \{ s_0t_0s_1t_1s_2t_2s_3: t_0\in I_0, \; t_1\in I_1,\; t_2\in I_2 \}
$$
the probability of the cylinder set $s_0I_0\dots s_{n-1}I_{n-1}s_n$
$$
\prod_{j=1}^n \bigg \{ \Pr(s_{j-1}, s_j) \cdot \int_{I_{j-1}} r(s_{j-1})\cdot \exp\{-r(s_{j-1})\cdot \tau\} \;\; d\tau \bigg \}
$$

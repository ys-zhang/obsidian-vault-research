> Static semantics is about typing rules, dynamic semantics is about execution rules.

**Dynamic semantics** is a framework in [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") and [natural language semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_semantics_(linguistics) "Formal semantics (linguistics)") that treats the meaning of a sentence as its potential to update a context. 
In static semantics, knowing the meaning of a sentence amounts to knowing when it is true; in dynamic semantics, knowing the meaning of a sentence means knowing "the change it brings about in the information state of anyone who accepts the news conveyed by it." In dynamic semantics, sentences are mapped to functions called _context change potentials_, which take an input context and return an output context.

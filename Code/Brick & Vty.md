## Render a Widget

Basically the `RenderM` gives 
- reading access to some render `Context n`
- some state `RenderState n`
```haskell
type RenderM n a = ReaderT (Context n) (State (RenderState n)) a
```


The rendering context's specification of available space will also govern how widgets get _cropped_, since all widgets are required to render to an image no larger than the rendering context specifies. If they do, they will be forcibly cropped.


# Elm

```haskell
-- the HTML code generated by `view` is capable of 
-- producing messages of type `msg`.
view :: Model -> Html Msg
update :: Msg -> Model -> IO Model -- we may do some IO here
```

**Trampolines** (sometimes referred to as [indirect jump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_jump "Indirect jump") vectors) are memory locations holding addresses pointing to [interrupt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt "Computer programming") service routines, [I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I/O "I/O") routines, etc. Execution jumps into the trampoline and then immediately jumps out, or bounces, hence the term _trampoline_. They have many uses:

-   Trampoline can be used to overcome the limitations imposed by a [central processing unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit "Central processing unit") (CPU) architecture that expects to always find vectors in fixed locations.
-   When an [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) is booted on a [symmetric multiprocessing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing "Symmetric multiprocessing") (SMP) machine, only one processor, the bootstrap processor, will be active. After the operating system has configured itself, it will instruct the other processors to jump to a piece of trampoline code that will initialize the processors and wait for the operating system to start scheduling threads on them.
